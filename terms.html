    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Mafia app and related services ("app", "service", or "we"). By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction to consent to terms) to use the app. By using the app, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to enter into these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. License and Use</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Mafia app for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and the applicable app store rules (Google Play, App Store). You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works from the app or its content, except as expressly permitted by us or by law.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the app only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
      <li>Infringe the rights of others (e.g. intellectual property, privacy).</li>
      <li>Transmit harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, other users' accounts, or any third-party services.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the app or its infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Account and Sign-In</h2>
    <p>Where the app offers sign-in (e.g. Google, Apple), you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activity under it. You must provide accurate information and notify us of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Any in-app purchases or subscriptions are subject to these Terms and to the respective store's terms (Google Play, App Store). Payments are processed by the store; refunds are handled according to the store's policies. We do not guarantee the availability or pricing of any paid feature for any specific period beyond what is stated in the app or at purchase.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP AND RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE (AND OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (USD 100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the app or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time, with or without cause or notice. Upon termination, your license to use the app ceases. Provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, indemnification) will survive termination.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on this page and update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms where permitted by law. If you do not agree, you must stop using the app.</p>

    <h2>11. General</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the app and supersede any prior agreements. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we operate, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
