    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Mafia app and related services ("app", "service", or "we"). The app is a host tool for the Mafia / Werewolf social deduction game: one phone, one host, pass-the-phone gameplay. By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of the App</h2>
    <p>The Mafia app is designed for a single host who runs the game on one device. Players pass the phone between them for night phases, voting, and role reveals. Features include: configurable roles and rules (e.g. Villager, Seer, Doctor, Mafia, Werewolf, and many others), presets and groups, day/night phases, voting (including optional secret voting), role reveal flows, game history and statistics, optional sign-in with Google or Apple, optional cloud sync of game history, themes and sound effects, and optional premium features (e.g. in-app purchases as described in the app). You may use the app as a guest (no account) or sign in to sync game history across devices. Use of the app is at your own risk; we do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction to consent to terms) to use the app. By using the app, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to enter into these Terms. If you are using the app on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.</p>

    <h2>3. License and Use</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Mafia app for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and the applicable app store rules (Google Play, App Store). You may not: copy, modify, distribute, sell, sublicense, or create derivative works from the app or its content (including but not limited to text, graphics, and role assets), except as expressly permitted by us or by law; reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app (except where permitted by applicable law); remove or alter any copyright or other proprietary notices; or use the app to build a competing product or service. All rights not granted here are reserved.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the app only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
      <li>Infringe the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of others.</li>
      <li>Transmit or facilitate harmful, offensive, harassing, or inappropriate content (including via player names or other user-entered text that you control).</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, other users' accounts, or any third-party services (including Firebase or the app stores).</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the app, its infrastructure, or the experience of others.</li>
      <li>Use the app for any commercial purpose (e.g. resale, hosting paid game sessions using the app in a way that implies our endorsement) without our prior written consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the app (including your account and cloud data) if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms. We are not obligated to monitor use but may do so to enforce these Terms or to protect the service.</p>

    <h2>5. Account and Sign-In</h2>
    <p>You may use the app as a guest (no account). If you sign in with Google or Apple, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activity under it. You must provide accurate information and notify us of any unauthorized use. When switching from guest to account, you may be asked whether to sync local data to the cloud or to clear local data and start fresh; that choice affects what data we store (see our Privacy Policy). Signing out does not automatically delete your cloud data; contact us if you want your account or cloud data deleted.</p>

    <h2>6. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some features may be offered as in-app purchases or subscriptions (e.g. premium or paid features). Any such purchases are subject to these Terms and to the respective store's terms and policies (Google Play, App Store). Payments are processed by the store; we do not receive or store your payment card details. Refunds are handled according to the store's policies. We do not guarantee the availability, pricing, or continued existence of any paid feature for any specific period beyond what is stated in the app or at purchase. If we discontinue a paid feature, we may (where required by law or policy) provide a refund or alternative in line with the store's rules.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Content and Data</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of content you create in the app (e.g. player names, group names, presets). By using the app, you grant us the rights necessary to operate and provide the service (e.g. to store and sync your game history when you have an account and choose to sync). We do not claim ownership of your content. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the app and any content you enter does not violate these Terms or any third-party rights. We may remove or refuse to store content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or the law.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP AND RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOUR USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES; IN SUCH CASES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE (AND OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM (FOR PAID FEATURES), OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (USD 100), WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the app, your content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the app (including your account and ability to use cloud sync) at any time, with or without cause or notice. Upon termination, your license to use the app ceases. We may delete or retain your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. Provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, indemnification, governing law) will survive termination. You may stop using the app at any time; signing out or uninstalling does not automatically delete cloud data—contact us if you want account or data deletion.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on this page and update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms where permitted by law. If you do not agree, you must stop using the app. For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g. in the app or by email where available).</p>

    <h2>13. General</h2>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the app and supersede any prior agreements. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we operate, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, except where prohibited. You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</p>
