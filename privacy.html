    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Mafia app ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our application on your device. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws and platform requirements (including Google Play and Apple App Store).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect or process the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive the identifier and basic profile data (e.g. email, display name) that the provider shares with us, in accordance with your sign-in choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and diagnostics:</strong> We may collect anonymous or aggregated usage data and crash reports to improve the app and fix issues (e.g. via Firebase or similar services).</li>
      <li><strong>Data you create in the app:</strong> Game setups, player names, presets, and similar in-app data are stored primarily on your device. If you use optional cloud or sync features, that data may be stored on our or our providers' servers to provide those features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and improve the Mafia app and its features.</li>
      <li>Authenticate you when you use sign-in (Google/Apple).</li>
      <li>Sync your data across devices when you use optional sync or cloud features.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage and diagnose problems in an aggregated or anonymized way.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We store data on your device and, where you use them, on secure servers operated by us or our service providers (e.g. Firebase). We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data; we cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the internet or stored on any system.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party services that process data on our behalf, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google (Firebase, Google Sign-In):</strong> Authentication, analytics, and cloud services. Their privacy policy applies to data they process: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple (Sign in with Apple):</strong> Authentication. Apple's privacy policy applies: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>In-app purchase providers (Google Play, App Store):</strong> For premium or in-app purchases, the respective store's terms and privacy policies apply to payment and purchase data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your region, you may have the right to:</p>

      <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
      <li>Data portability where applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage sign-in and many in-app settings (including sync) from within the app. To exercise other rights or ask questions, contact us using the details in the "Contact" section below.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not directed at children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses or equivalent) where required by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy where permitted by law.</p>
